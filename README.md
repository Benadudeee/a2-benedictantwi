This is a small scale single page app for users to plan their activities. When they enter a entry, it adds the task and a derrived value for the days they have left to complete the task.

Technical Achievements
===

* Created the entire app single paged using data client side and server side. Creating a system that allowed the  client   and server to communicate without data loss/error was pretty tricky fron the start, but I made an okay system for it.  When an item is added, the server calculates the number of days left by subtracting the time due by the time it was created, this is then pushed to the client, showing the added tasks with the previous ones.

* Tech Achievement 2: Added the ability to toggle the task complete or incomplete through a single button press. It's relatively simple, but it updates the data inside the server so it should count as modifying the data.
